# Audio Analysis App

This App has been developed to view the analysis of an audio file via MATLAB. 
Feature exctraction algorithms used found in MATLAB toolbox. This app used MATLAB R2021b version for academic use.


The feature extraction algorithms in following are used in this application:

1. Spectral Entropy 
2. Spectral Centroid
3. Spectral Slope
4. Mel Cepstral Coeffient
5. MFCC
6. GTCC
7. Pitch
